# Step-Health-Tracker
## 📌 Project Overview
The Step & Health Tracker Dashboard is a comprehensive Power BI project designed to analyze daily activity, sleep, hydration, and mood data. Spread across three interactive pages, the dashboard uncovers personal health patterns, goal achievements, and correlations between lifestyle habits and well-being.

## 🎯 Objective
• Track daily steps, distance, and active minutes.<br>
• Monitor sleep hours, water intake, and goal achievements.<br>
• Explore trends in activity & wellness across weekdays and months.<br>
• Understand correlations between mood, hydration, sleep, and activity levels.<br>
• Derive actionable insights to improve daily performance & well-being.<br>

## 📂 About the Dataset
• Personal Health Tracking Data <br>
• Contains fields for:<br>
  • Steps, Distance, Active Minutes<br>
  • Sleep Hours, Water Intake (Liters)<br>
  • Mood (Happy, Energetic, Sad, Tired, Stressed)<br>
  • Date, Weekday, Month<br>

## 🔍 Recommended Analysis
• How do activity levels vary across weekdays and months?<br>
✅ Steps peak mid-week, dip on weekends.<br>
• What role does hydration play in daily performance?<br>
✅ Higher water intake → higher steps & better sleep.<br>
• Do moods correlate with health behaviours?<br>
✅ Negative moods (Sad, Tired, Stressed) → fewer steps, less sleep, lower hydration.<br>
• How often were daily goals achieved?<br>
✅ ~65% of days met the step target; hydration targets were less consistent.<br>
• Which factors most impact productivity/energy?<br>
✅ Mood and hydration strongly influence sleep quality & activity consistency.<br>

## 📌 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
⦁ Total Steps Walked: 5M<br>
⦁ Average Daily Steps: 10.24K<br>
⦁ Average Sleep Hours: 7.29hrs<br>
⦁ Average Daily Water Intake: 2.51L<br>
⦁ Step Goal Achievement Rate: 52.80%<br>
⦁ Total Calories Burnt : 153.58k<br>
⦁ Longest Streak : 264<br>
⦁ Days Missed Step Goal : 143<br>

## 💡 Key Insights from the Dashboard
• Steps & Activity – Average daily steps show mid-week peaks, while weekends tend to drop. Around 65% of days achieved the step goal.<br>
• Sleep Patterns – Consistent sleep improves activity; shorter nights correlate with reduced step counts.<br>
• Hydration – Higher water intake is linked to better step performance and longer sleep duration.<br>
• Mood Impact – Positive moods (Happy, Energetic) align with higher steps and hydration, while negative moods (Sad, Tired, Stressed) reduce overall performance.<br>
• Weekday vs Weekend – Clear lifestyle gap observed: weekdays are more active, weekends less consistent.<br>
	
## 📌 Technologies Used
• Power BI – Visual analytics and report building<br>
• DAX – KPIs, calculated columns, time intelligence functions<br>
• Power Query Editor – Data transformation and cleaning<br>
• Custom Icons and Layout – Enhanced visual appeal<br>
• Slicers & Page Navigation – Seamless interactivity<br>

## 🎯 Conclusion
This dashboard project demonstrates the power of self-tracking + data storytelling. By analyzing steps, sleep, hydration, and mood, it highlights how daily behaviors influence overall well-being. The insights help create actionable goals for improving lifestyle balance.
